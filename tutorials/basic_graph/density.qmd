title: "Density Plots"
---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
diabetes <- readRDS("data/diabetes.rds")
```

A density plot provides a smooth estimate of a continuous variableâ€™s distribution using density estimation. Unlike histograms, density plots are not dependent on bin width but instead on a smoothing parameter (bandwidth). They are especially useful for comparing multiple distributions in a clean, smooth form.

We first compute a density estimate with `density()` and then plot it:

```{r}
d <- density(diabetes$bmi)
plot(d)
```

Since the result of `density()` is an object with x (values) and y (estimated density) components, we can plot it manually for more control:

```{r}
d %$% plot(y = y, x = x, type = "l")
```

You can overlay density plots from different groups on the same chart (changing colors or line types) to compare shapes without cluttering the display with discrete bins.
